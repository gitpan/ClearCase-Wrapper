Revision history for Perl extension ClearCase::Wrapper.

0.01  Tue Mar 28 10:59:30 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20
	- This is a replacement for ClearCase::Ct and picks up
	  where version 1.20 of that leaves off.

0.10 Thu Apr  6 03:32:02 EDT 2000
	- First version in production use. Has not brought all
	  the esoteric, underused functionality of ClearCase::Ct
	  along but all the core stuff seems to work just fine.

0.14 Fri May 12 12:13:11 EDT 2000
	- FCS (first CPAN shipment). Some extensions tested on NT, not
	  all.

0.15 Wed May 31 17:10:08 EDT 2000
	- Added 'lock -{allow,deny} flags.
	- Fixed spurious warnings going into interactive mode.
	- Added default for 'ct ci'.

0.17 Tue Jul  4 22:52:08 EDT 2000
	- Reworked setview/workon implementation.

0.18 Sat Jul 15 08:56:38 EDT 2000
	- Improvements to winkout.
	- Various bugfixes in sample enhancements.
	- Added -M flag.
	- Only expand symlinks for ci/co cmds.
	- New $CLEARCASE_WRAPPER_NATIVE EV to suppress all extensions.
	- New mount extension for Windows.

0.20 Wed Aug  9 13:52:56 EDT 2000
	- Added mkelem -do flag.
	- The usual round of bugfixes to sample enhancements.

0.21 Fri Sep 22 10:02:24 EDT 2000
	- Added 'diffcs' command.

0.22 Wed Nov  1 20:58:08 EST 2000
	- Some work on mkelem to allow aggregation to work
	  in snapshot views (untested).
	- Added a dependency on File::Spec 0.82, just because it's
	  goodness and makes coding of ClearCase::Wrapper easier.
	- Added support for a Site.pm file containing site-specific
	  work. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, as without Site.pm
	  it's hard to modify and/or add new features to
	  the module and also accept new versions from CPAN.
