Revision history for Perl extension ClearCase::Wrapper.

0.01  Tue Mar 28 10:59:30 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20
	- This is a replacement for ClearCase::Ct and picks up
	  where version 1.20 of that leaves off.

0.10 Thu Apr  6 03:32:02 EDT 2000
	- First version in production use. Has not brought all
	  the esoteric, underused functionality of ClearCase::Ct
	  along but all the core stuff seems to work just fine.

0.14 Fri May 12 12:13:11 EDT 2000
	- FCS (first CPAN shipment). Some extensions tested on NT, not
	  all.

0.15 Wed May 31 17:10:08 EDT 2000
	- Added 'lock -{allow,deny} flags.
	- Fixed spurious warnings going into interactive mode.
	- Added default for 'ct ci'.

0.17 Tue Jul  4 22:52:08 EDT 2000
	- Reworked setview/workon implementation.

0.18 Sat Jul 15 08:56:38 EDT 2000
	- Improvements to winkout.
	- Various bugfixes in sample enhancements.
	- Added -M flag.
	- Only expand symlinks for ci/co cmds.
	- New $CLEARCASE_WRAPPER_NATIVE EV to suppress all extensions.
	- New mount extension for Windows.

0.20 Wed Aug  9 13:52:56 EDT 2000
	- Added mkelem -do flag.
	- The usual round of bugfixes to sample enhancements.

0.21 Fri Sep 22 10:02:24 EDT 2000
	- Added 'diffcs' command.

0.22 Wed Nov  1 20:58:08 EST 2000
	- Some work on mkelem to allow aggregation to work
	  in snapshot views (untested).
	- Added a dependency on File::Spec 0.82, just because it's
	  goodness and makes coding of ClearCase::Wrapper easier.
	- Added support for a Site.pm file containing site-specific
	  work. This is a significant improvement, as without Site.pm
	  it's hard to modify and/or add new features to
	  the module and also accept new versions from CPAN.

0.23 Mon May 14 11:11:16 EDT 2001
	- Reworked mkview code to depend on CC storage locations.
	  Note: this mkview code now requires CC 4.1 or above.

0.24 Fri May 18 11:52:43 EDT 2001
	- Added checkout -dir/-rec. It was in an old rev and I was
	  asked to put it back.
	- Added mkelem -ok

0.25 Thu Sep 20 15:42:01 EDT 2001
	- Various minor tweaks.
	- Added CLEARCASE_WRAPPER_PAGER to go with -M.
	- Added recheckout ('ct reco') feature.

0.26 Wed Jan 30 09:03:16 EST 2002
	- RETIRING the 0.* line of ClearCase::Wrapper. There's
	  a rewritten version starting at 1.00. This version
	  (0.26) is being only to remove the old Site.pm
	  functionality from the old line because it can
	  confuse CPAN users attempting to get to the new
	  code. If you download this version, don't use it.
	  Use the latest instead.
